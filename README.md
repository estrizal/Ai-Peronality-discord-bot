# Ai-Peronality-discord-bot
AI powered discord chat bots with personality for Free âœ¨ Using Google's palm 2 text generation. 

Prerequisite:- 
* A GOOGLE ACCOUNT (i mean.. who doesn't have it) 
* Broke (if have money, get GPT keys and use some other repo. This bot is for broke people like me)
* python installed on your system
* do pip install google-generativeai
* then also do pip install discord

Step 1: 
Get API keys from here- https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey 
put them in the 'Palm_API_Keys ' variable.  in the code. 

Step 2: 
Issue a bot token from here:- https://discord.com/developers/applications
Put it in the 'DISCORD_TOKEN' variable in the code.

Step 3:
Finally it should look something like this. And yes. I recently uninstalled python and VS code. Notepad supremacyyyy.

Step 4: 
Edit the input and output in the "prompt{" thingy.. and it'll behave like that.. By default it behaves like mizuhara from rent a girlfriend anime. change the input output to make it behave like you want.

Step 5: 
*Change the things in "Default{" thingy to block potentially harmful responses from the bot* By default, it's said to block NO HARMFUL responses. And bot can behave really mean/toxic too.

Step 6:
Injoii your bot..  BTW there might be better ways to add personality. I just made it in like.. a weekend. so didn't explore much which makesuite/vector Ai had to offer.
